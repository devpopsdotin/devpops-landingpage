# Deployment Fix for Directory Structure Issue

## Problem
The deployment fails because:
- The build creates `dist/public/index.html` but deployment expects `dist/index.html`
- Static deployment expects a flat directory structure

## Solution
Use the provided deployment script to fix the build structure:

```bash
node deploy-build.js
```

This script will:
1. Run the normal build process
2. Move all files from `dist/public/` to `dist/` root
3. Remove the empty `dist/public/` directory
4. Verify the correct structure for deployment

## Alternative Manual Fix
If you prefer to do this manually:

```bash
# After running npm run build
cp -r dist/public/* dist/
rm -rf dist/public
```

## What This Fixes
- ✅ Places `index.html` directly in `dist/` 
- ✅ Moves all assets to the correct deployment structure
- ✅ Ensures Replit deployment can find the required files

## Deployment Steps
1. Run: `node deploy-build.js`
2. Verify `index.html` exists in `dist/` root
3. Deploy using Replit's deployment feature
4. Set the public directory to `dist` in deployment settings
