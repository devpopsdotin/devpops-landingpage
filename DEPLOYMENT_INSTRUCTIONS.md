# Deployment Fix Instructions

## Issue Summary
The deployment fails because the build outputs files to `dist/public/` but deployment expects them directly in `dist/`.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Use the provided fix script
```bash
./fix-deployment.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual fix after build
```bash
# After running your build
mv dist/public/* dist/
rmdir dist/public
```

### Option 3: Update deployment settings
In your Replit deployment configuration:
- Change the public directory from `dist` to `dist/public`

## Build Process
1. Run your normal build: `npm run build`
2. Apply one of the fixes above
3. Verify `index.html` exists directly in `dist/`
4. Deploy using Replit's deployment feature

## Verification
After applying the fix, your `dist/` directory should contain:
- `index.html` (required)
- `assets/` folder with CSS/JS files
- Any other static assets

The deployment will succeed once `index.html` is found directly in the `dist/` directory.
